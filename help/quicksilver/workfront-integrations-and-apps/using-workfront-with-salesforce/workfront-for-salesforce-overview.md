>[!IMPORTANT]

>Per offrire integrazioni più stabili e scalabili, abbiamo optato per un approccio di integrazione moderno e flessibile che utilizza l’automazione e l’integrazione di Workfront (Fusion). Nell&#39;ambito di questo processo di transizione, l&#39;integrazione di Workfront per Salesforce **non è più disponibile**.
>
>È consigliabile utilizzare l’automazione e l’integrazione di Workfront per le esigenze di integrazione della tua organizzazione con Salesforce.

## [!DNL Workfront for Salesforce]

You can do the following when using [!DNL Workfront for Salesforce]:

* Manually create new [!DNL Workfront] requests from [!DNL Salesforce] within an Opportunity or an Account.

   For more information, see [Submit [!DNL Adobe Workfront] requests from [!DNL Salesforce] objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/submit-workfront-requests-from-salesforce-objects.md).

* Automatically trigger the creation of projects in [!DNL Workfront] when certain criteria are met in [!DNL Salesforce]. Your [!DNL Salesforce] system administrator must configure triggers for creating projects from [!DNL Salesforce].

   For more information about creating [!DNL Workfront] projects from [!DNL Salesforce], see [Create [!DNL Adobe Workfront] projects from [!DNL Salesforce] objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/create-wf-projects-from-salesforce-objects.md).

Consider the following when working with [!DNL Workfront] for [!DNL Salesforce]:

* We support both the [!DNL Salesforce Classic] and [!DNL Lightning Experience] frameworks.
* Items can be created only from [!DNL Salesforce] to [!DNL Workfront].
* You can view some information about the [!DNL Workfront] items in [!DNL Salesforce]. This information cannot be customized.

   For a list of [!DNL Workfront] fields that you can view from [!DNL Salesforce], see  [Submit [!DNL Adobe Workfront] requests from [!DNL Salesforce] objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/submit-workfront-requests-from-salesforce-objects.md)  and [Create [!DNL Adobe Workfront] projects from [!DNL Salesforce] objects](../../workfront-integrations-and-apps/using-workfront-with-salesforce/create-wf-projects-from-salesforce-objects.md).

* You can directly access items linked to [!DNL Salesforce] by clicking the [!UICONTROL Go to Salesforce] link from Workfront.

   You cannot view any information about the [!DNL Salesforce] items in [!DNL Workfront], but there's a link in Workfront that takes you to the item in Salesforce so you can review it there.

   [!UICONTROL The Go to Salesforce] link displays in the following areas:

    * The [!UICONTROL Details] section of a project or an issue.
    * The header of a project or an issue.

      Your system or group administrator must add the [!UICONTROL Integrations] field to your Layout Template to view the [!UICONTROL Go to Salesforce] link in the project or issue header.
    * The [!DNL Summary] panel  of an issue when selecting the issue in a list, after clicking [!UICONTROL Open Summary] ![Summary panel icon](assets/summary-panel-icon.png) in the list's toolbar.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The [!UICONTROL Go to Salesforce] link is visible to all [!DNL Workfront] users who can view the project or the issue. You must have a [!DNL Salesforce] account to be able to go to the [!DNL Salesforce] Opportunity or Account where the issue was logged.

* Updating fields on one item in one application does not update any information on linked items in the other application.
